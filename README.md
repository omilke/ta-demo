# ta-demo
This is a demonstration project for @EJB rollback behaviour. I have added TODO markers where you can play a little with different setups.

#deploy
You can use mvn clean package to build the project. It is designed to work on glassfish3. However it also works on glassfish4 (you can change the javaee-api version 7). This is a netbeans project, therefore you have it up running with netbeans and glassfish in no time.

If you have any feedback, please contact me.

Enjoy!
